# Documentation Index

Welcome to VivariumAssistant docs. This folder is the “how it works” companion to the codebase.

## Start here
- **Getting Started:** `getting-started.md`
- **Architecture overview:** `architecture.md`
- **Configuration (YAML):** `configuration.md`
- **Logging & observability:** `logging.md`
- **Glossary:** `glossary.md`

## Guides (specs & behavior)
Guides are deeper dives into specific behavior contracts.
- `guides/control-loop-contract.md`
- `guides/manual-override.md`
- `guides/mist-scheduling.md`

## Decisions (ADRs)
`decisions/` contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): short documents that explain *why* we chose an approach.
- New decisions should be added as `docs/decisions/NNN-title.md` (e.g., `001-config-yaml.md`).
